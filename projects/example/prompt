I want to build a CRM software with a white and teal theme using software that can make an app. The software should be clean, modern, and professional, with an easy-to-use and intuitive user interface. It should be feature-rich and provide all of the functionality that a business needs to manage its customer relationships, including tracking leads, managing sales opportunities, providing customer support, and generating reports. The software should also be scalable and able to grow with the business, as well as secure and protect customer data.

Here are some specific features that I would like to see in the software:

A dashboard that provides a quick overview of key metrics, such as leads, opportunities, and sales.
A pipeline view that shows the status of all sales opportunities.
A contact management system that allows me to track and manage my relationships with customers.
A task management system that helps me to stay organized and on top of my work.
A reporting system that allows me to generate reports on my sales, marketing, and customer data.
